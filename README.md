My First Repo

Hello World,

PM checking in! I am a long-time technology enthusiast with an excitement for disruptive businesses. I have had experience leading product development teams for both B2C and B2B products. 

Currently, as a Senior PM at Microsoft (on the Office365 team), I am leading a development team to build the next generation "on-the-go" mobile productivity suite.
